    "### Strategy\n",
    "- We will begin with 3 different types of classifiers and conduct a preliminary analysis on their ability to perform the required classification\n",
    "- After evaluating the preliminary modeling stage we will pick one out of the 3 and perform a grid search to further optimize the solution\n",
    "\n",
    "### Metrics\n",
    "- In order to evaluate the performance of the classification model we will employ a F-beta score that gives more importance to precision as compared to recall.\n",
    "- This is because there is a cost associated with sending offers to unresponsive customers.\n",
    "    - An unresponsive customer might complete the offer without even seeing it, which means we could have saved money by not showing the customer this offer\n",
    "    - An unresposive cusomter might not complete the offer if they see it, which means the offer is negatively impacting their spending.\n",
    "- With this in mind we will want to minimize the False Positives and hence give more importance to precision rather than recall."
