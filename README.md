# Purchase_Behavior

## Introduction
This repository contains a jupyter notebook containing the code for a project completed as a part of Udacity's nanodegree program.

In this project we were given a hypothetical dataset of customers from starbucks along with their transaction activity. These customers were optionally shown promotional offers which potentially effects their behavior. The key task we try to solve here is to figure out whether or not we should show a certain offer to a customer.

We outline the details in a medium blog post https://medium.com/@dileeprkini/promotions-to-show-or-not-to-show-eb0029fdd01b

## Requirments
The following packages were used to prepare the notebook
- numpy 1.13.3
- pandas 0.25.0
- scikit-learn 0.19.1
- plotly 3.4.2
